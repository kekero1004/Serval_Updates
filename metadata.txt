changelog=
        3.33.0 Enhanced with advanced filtering capabilities:
            * Fill Voids - NoData area interpolation with IDW, Bilinear, Kriging methods
            * Terrain Filter - DSM to DTM conversion with morphological filtering
            * Outlier Filter - Statistical, MAD, IQR-based outlier detection and removal
            * Interpolate from Edges - Edge-based interpolation for selected areas
            * Average Filter - Uniform, Gaussian, Distance-weighted averaging
            * Constrained Filter - Limited-change averaging with slope preservation
            * Median Filter - Noise reduction with various kernel shapes
            * Enhanced compatibility for QGIS 3.36+
        3.32.0 Added new raster type (Int8) to provider types
        3.10.5 Handle rasters with invalid path
        3.10.4 Fix for XYZ rasters and others non-GDAL providers
        3.10.3 Improved checking raster driver capabilities, added option to hide Serval toolbars
        3.10.2 Set some menu actions to be always ON
        3.10.1 Fixed CRS transform issues, updated documentation.
        3.10.0 New features:
            * multi-band rasters support
            * raster cells selection tools
            * saving/loading selections to/from map layers
            * QGIS expressions support including interpolation from vector and mesh layers
            * low-pass 3x3 raster filtering
        3.0.1 Fixed setting working raster in Linux (issue #18)
        3.0 Port to QGIS 3
        0.8.1 Added support for Float64 data type
        0.8 Plugin interface is now plain toolbar (no dock widget). Workaround for Python crashes under Windows. New features:
            * undo/redo
            * define/change NoData value for raster bands
            * erase (assign NoData value to a cell)
        0.6 new features:
            * 3 bands rasters supported
            * working modes (probing, drawing)
            * QGIS color picker
